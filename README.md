# reading-levels
A helpful mini-terface, utilizing JS, to direct families to appropriate reading material based on user input. Live!

I wanted to explore working with JS and links - and I knew that my classroom community could benefit from having reliable access to information about leveled books for their learners. The result is this little page, also from my Ziggy-induced dev phase. I'm in process with updating it with some of the spiffy neon-gradient features that are flickering around the web. I'm looking forward to further experimentation with links using React.
